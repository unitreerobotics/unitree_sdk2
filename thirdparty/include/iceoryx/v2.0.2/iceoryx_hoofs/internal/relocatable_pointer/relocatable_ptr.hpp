/// @brief Smart pointer type that allows objects using it to able to be copied by memcpy
///        without invalidating the pointer.
///        This applies only if it points to memory owned by the object itself
///        (i.e. not to memory outside of the object).
///        This is useful to improve copy-efficiency and allow the types build with relocatable
///        pointers only to be stored in shared memory.
///        It is usable like a raw pointer of the corresponding type and can be implicily
///        converted to one.
///
/// @tparam T the native type wrapped by the relocatable_ptr, i.e. relocatable_ptr<T>
///         has native type T and corresponds to a raw pointer of type T*.
///
/// @note It is advisable to use relocatable_ptr only for storage (e.g. member variables),
///       not to pass them around as function arguments or as return value.
///       There should be no need for this, since as pass-around type
///       regular pointers do the job just fine and do not incur
///       the slight runtime overhead of a relocatable_ptr.
///       There should be no memory overhead on 64 bit systems.
/// @note relocatable_ptr is not trivially copyable since in general the copy constructor
///       requires additional logic. Hence obects that contain it re not trivially
///       copyable in the C++ sense. However, if the pointees of a host object containing the
///       relocatable ptr are all located inside the object and the object is otherwise trivially
///       copyable it can be safely copied by memcpy.
